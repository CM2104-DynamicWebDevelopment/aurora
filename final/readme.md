# Final: Back-End

The final version of the site uses a NodeJS backend and EJS template engine, served by Express to create a dynamic version of the Aurora website. The login system is replaced by a more secure MongoDB database, the (previously static) content is created through EJS pages and partials and images can be uploaded (in development.)
