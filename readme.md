## Project Aurora
Aurora is a web application that helps to find the best locations for observing the Aurora Borealis in Great Britain. The map shows locations where our users observed this magnificent phenomenon. You can click on the pins on the map to check the date, time, exact coordinates for the location and the total number of observations registered at that point by our community.

To help you plan the best Northern Lights experience, we provide you with a weather forecast and the preditctions how likely it is to see an Aurora.
